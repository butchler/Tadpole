To-Do List
==========
* Create created time and last modified time editing for pages (getdate() and mktime() should help)
* Add an actual example frontend, not just "This is the home page"
* Add table prefix functionality
* Add page parts
* Change editing pages to use tables instead of divs
  * And just improve the HTML and CSS of the admin while you're at it
