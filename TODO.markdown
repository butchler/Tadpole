To-Do List
==========
* Create created time and last modified time editing for pages (and just in general as a field type) (getdate() and mktime() should help)
* Add table prefix functionality
* Make more user friendly install script
* Fix validating for integers, find out how to determine if a string is an integer but not a float
* Add page parts like in Frog (maybe)
* Improve page list page, such as adding checkboxes and buttons to perform batch operations on pages, and drag and drop functionality like Frog (maybe)
